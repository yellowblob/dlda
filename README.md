# The fully automated Robert

This Code was developed for the theatre project *The life of the other* at Theater Freiburg.
The Processing sketch listens via an Arduino for someone pushing the big red push button. It then projects a question from a set of random and a set of predefined questions the performers on stage have to answer.
